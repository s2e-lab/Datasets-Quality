     * In this problem, you will implement a function that takes two lists of numbers,

     * between them to make lst1 a list of only even numbers.
     * There is no limit on the number of exchanged elements between lst1 and lst2.
     * If it is possible to exchange elements between the lst1 and lst2 to make
     * all the elements of lst1 to be even, return "YES".
     * Otherwise, return "NO".
     * For example:
     * exchange([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 2, 3, 4]) => "YES"
     * exchange([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 5, 3, 4]) => "NO"
     * It is assumed that the input lists will be non-empty.
