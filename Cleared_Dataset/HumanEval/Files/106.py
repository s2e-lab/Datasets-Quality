    Implement the function f that takes n as a parameter
    and returns a list of size n, such that the value of the element at index i is the factorial of i if i is even
    or the sum of numbers from 1 to i otherwise.
    i start from 1.
    The factorial of i is the multiplication of the numbers from 1 to i (1 * 2 * ... * i).
