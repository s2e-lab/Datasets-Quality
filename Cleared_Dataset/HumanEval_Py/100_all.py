def make_a_pile(n: int) -> List[int]:
    """
    Given a positive integer n, you have to make a pile of n levels of stones.
    The first level has n stones.
    The number of stones in the next level is:
        - the next odd number if n is odd.
        - the next even number if n is even.
    Return the number of stones in each level in a list, where element at index
    i represents the number of stones in the level (i+1).

    args:
        n: positive integer

    returns:
        list of integers, where element at index i represents the number of stones in the level (i+1)


    Examples:
    >>> make_a_pile(3)
    [3, 5, 7]
    >>> make_a_pile(4)
    [4, 6, 8, 10]
